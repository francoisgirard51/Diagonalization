# Diagonalization
Basic algorithm for finding an eigenvector and an eigenvalue

**I First version**

- With the value of c_1 found above define B = c_1 \* I - A where I is the identity matrix 2 by 2.
- Display the matrix B thus obtained.
- Repeat the same as in question 2 with this matrix B and new variables V_2, c_2 and W_2.
- display the final value of c_1 - c_2

**II - Second version**

1. Assuming that A has two eigenvalues lambda_1 and lambda_2 with lambda_1 = c_1, what are the eigenvalues of B?
2. Give approximate values of the eigenvalues of B.
3. Deduce the second eigenvalue of A and an associated eigenvector.
