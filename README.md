## I/ Objectives:
Build a basic algorithm for finding an eigenvector and an eigenvalue of matrices within the framework of a diagonalization exercice.

## II/ First version:
- With the value of `c_1` found above define `B = c_1 \* I - A` where `I` is the identity matrix 2 by 2.
- Display the matrix `B` thus obtained.
- Repeat the same as in question 2 with this matrix B and new variables `V_2`, `c_2` and `W_2`.
- display the final value of `c_1 - c_2`

## III/ Second version:
- Assuming that `A` has two eigenvalues `lambda_1` and `lambda_2` with `lambda_1 = c_1`, what are the eigenvalues of `B`?
- Give approximate values of the eigenvalues of `B`.
- Deduce the second eigenvalue of `A` and an associated eigenvector.

## IV/ Matrix calculus with Python:
Calculate the product Y = AX from the example given above and display the matrix `A` and the vectors `X` and `Y`.
